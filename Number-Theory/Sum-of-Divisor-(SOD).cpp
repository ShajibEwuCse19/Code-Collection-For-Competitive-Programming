Let, n = 12;

Divisors of 12 = 1 2 3 4 6 12
Sum of Divisor, SOD(12) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28
  
Now, Prime Factor of 12 = 2 , 2 , 3 কারণ (2 x 2 x 3 = 12 )
                        = (2^2 , 3^1)
  
    SOD(12)             = sum of all combination of  (2^2 , 3^1)
                        = (2^0 x 3^0) + (2^1 x 3^0) + (2^2 x 3^0) + (2^0 x 3^1) + (2^1 x 3^1) + (2^2 x 3^1) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 12 = 28
                        = 2^0 (3^0 + 3^1) + 2^1 (3^0 + 3^1) + 2^2 (3^0 + 3^1) -> Common numbers 
                        = (3^0 + 3^1) x (2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2) -> Common (3^0 + 3^1) the we'll get the common pattern.
                        = (1 + 3 ) x ( 1 + 2 + 4 )
                        = 4 x 7
                        = 28 (From Prime Factorization).
  
Common Pattern for all numbers,
SOD(x) = p^a , q^b , r^c
       = (p^0 + p^1 + --- + p^a) + (q^0 + q^1 + --- + p^b) + (r^0 + r^1 + --- + r^c)
